**Today's Progress**: Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Lesson 1. Getting Started

- [x] Video: Lesson 1. Getting Started

**Thoughts**: Interesting! I want to read a book called "Meta Learning" written by Radek Osmulski, which was mentioned in the lecture video. I guess it is about how to study deep learning.

**Today's Progress**: fastai PDLC Lesson 1 Review

- [x] Kaggle notebooks: Is it a bird? Creating a model from your own data
  - [x] Created a project based on the project above. - [Is a patient falling from the bed or not?](https://github.com/positive235/patient-falling-binary-classification)
- [x] Book: Meta Learning by Radek Osmulski **[In Progress]**
- [x] Book: A Mathematician's Lament by Paul Lockhart **[In Progress]**
- [x] Book: Making Learning Whole by David Perkins **[In Progress]**

**Thoughts**: It was fun working with my project which classifies a patient falling from the bed or not(binary classfication) and writing its introduction, limitations and improvements.
